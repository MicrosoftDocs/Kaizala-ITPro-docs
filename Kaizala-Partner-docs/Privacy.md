# Approach 

Microsoft understands that our customers, who use our business cloud services, entrust us with their most valuable asset — data. Customers trust that its privacy will be protected and that it will be used only in a way that is consistent with their expectations. 

Microsoft Kaizala follows privacy processes to make sure that it adheres to the customer promises. [Privacy statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement) provides more details on how Microsoft collects data and uses its data for effectively running the services. 

Kaizala mobile app also implements specific privacy controls such as a user’s phone number is never visible to others in the group unless the other person already has the user added to the phone book list. This restricts an undesired disclosure of phone numbers in a large setup.
